    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <article>
        <p>A result-oriented, creative thinking, seasoned and curious Software Engineer with over 10 years of professional experience in building different web services: from microblogging service to ISP equipment configuring software and Cisco voice systems integration.</p>

        <p>I like to build simple and useful online services that make actual sense for people, to visualize data on maps, because some data, even logs of distributed systems, is much more understandable while represented visually, not just by numbers.

        <ul>
            <li>web services development with Python, Perl, PHP, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, MySQL</li>
            <li>development of online map services with Leaflet, Google Maps, PostGIS, TileMill, OpenStreetMap</li>
